# Basic-Wordle-Bot
Simple Wordle Bot made in python
- It automatically figures out the next word and enters it for you until it it wins or fails.
- Uses a basic linear search algorithm and conditionals to find the next matching word.
- Has a 5-word database in WordFile.txt: Currently contains 3317 words. This is not the full database for wordle.
- Bot is not 100% accurate and may fail in some cases (e.g. if the word is not in the database).
- Also currently only works on WordleCup.io and not the original Wordle game, but can be easily modified to do so.
- Created by: Bengu270

# Instructions for use:
- Must have a python interpreter
- Open WordleCup.io, start a game and run the program. Click on the wordle grid first to select it before pressing the 'shift' key to activate the bot. It will automatically fill in the words and stop when the end screen is displayed.
- Disclaimer: Using this to cheat in public lobbies is mean.
